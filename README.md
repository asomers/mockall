## Overview

Mock objects are a powerful technique for unit testing software.  A mock object
is an object with the same interface as a real object, but whose responses are
all manually controlled by test code.  They can be used to test the upper and
middle layers of an application without instantiating the lower ones, or to
inject edge and error cases that would be difficult or impossible to create
when using the full stack.

Statically typed languages are inherently more difficult to
mock than dynamically typed languages. Since Rust is a statically typed language, 
previous attempts at creating a mock object library have had mixed results. Mockall 
incorporates the best elements of previous designs, resulting in it having a rich 
feature set with a terse and ergonomic interface. Mockall is written in 100% *safe* 
and *stable* Rust.

## Usage

Typically mockall is only used by unit tests.  To use it this way, add this to
your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
mockall = "0.12.1"
```

Then use it like this:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
use mockall::{automock, mock, predicate::*};
#[cfg_attr(test, automock)]
trait MyTrait {
    fn foo(&self, x: u32) -> u32;
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn mytest() {
        let mut mock = MockMyTrait::new();
        mock.expect_foo()
            .with(eq(4))
            .times(1)
            .returning(|x| x + 1);
        assert_eq!(5, mock.foo(4));
    }
}
```

# Acknowledgements

Mockall was not built in a day.  JMock was probably the first popular mock
object library.  Many ports and imitations have been made, including GoogleMock
for C++.  Mockers, inspired by GoogleMock, was the first attempt to bring the
concept to Rust.  The now-defunct Mock_derive was the first library to generate
mock objects with procedural macros, greatly reducing the user's workload.
Mockall also uses proc macros, and copies many of Mockers' features and
conventions.  Mockall also takes inspiration from Simulacrum's internal design,
and its technique for mocking generic methods.
